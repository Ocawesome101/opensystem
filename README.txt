// Open System

This is a very simple, vaguely Mac-inspired GUI toolkit plus OS for OpenComputers.  Probably easily portable, though this uses globals because it was easier.

//// Apps

Apps are defined similarly to libraries.  See `monitor.lua` for an example.

Apps are refreshed once per at least once per second.
